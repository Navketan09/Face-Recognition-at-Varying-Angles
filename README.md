# Face-Recognition-at-Varying-Angles
Face recognition is a process with many applications for its nature of being non-intrusive, natural, and passive. Especially, in applications such as surveillance systems, smart homes, or any application which is dealing with identifying people from images or videos However, it is very much challenging task to detect, identify and recognize faces from real-time scenarios where the environment is susceptible to expression, occlusion, or even pose variations Among many applications, possible implementation areas for face recognition techniques are home safety applications, Security surveillance etc. Face recognition and extraction of various face features without much error by using such system should be very accurate. But it is difficult task while dealing with face identification using side view or multi angled image. There might not be proper clarity or visibility of every facial component like eyes, nose mouth corners etc. in a single side image of a person. If we use a system using only one side view image it is extremely difficult. So, in efficient face identification system angle of face in image play vital role.
